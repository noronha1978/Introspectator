Notes on stuff


Features
* I want to see for methods if they are private, protected, public

* Given a method what are the dependencies in the method
Are they 
1) method local variables - possible
2) Parameters - possible
3) Return types - possible


* I want to see for properties if they are private, protectd, public

* I want to see the web of interconnections among types and also should be able to drill down and see the methods and properties that are 
contributing to the interconnections


Given a property what are the dependencies on the property

What are the dependencies of the class itself

What are the inheritance hierarchies of the class
